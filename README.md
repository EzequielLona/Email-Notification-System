# Email-Notification-System
Description:
The Email Notification System is a software application designed to monitor and record the opening and closing of programs on a computer system. The main objective of this solution is to provide instant email alerts whenever a specific program, in this case, the command console (cmd), is opened or closed.

This development integrates with the computer's operating system and utilizes advanced monitoring techniques to detect the opening and closing events of the target program. Once the opening of cmd is detected, the system will automatically generate an email and send it to the user-specified address. The email will include relevant details such as the exact time the program was opened and any additional configured information to include, such as the current user's name and the computer's IP address.

In addition to the opening notification, the Email Notification System will also monitor the closing of the target program. When cmd is closed, another notification email will be generated, providing the exact time of the closing event.

The Email Notification System is highly customizable and flexible. Users have the ability to configure which programs they want to monitor and receive notifications for, allowing them to tailor the solution to their specific needs. They can also customize the content and format of the notification emails to suit their preferences.

In summary, this development offers an efficient way to monitor the opening and closing of the cmd program and receive immediate notifications via email. It provides users with greater control and awareness of activities on their computer system, which can be useful for detecting unauthorized actions or monitoring proper resource usage.
